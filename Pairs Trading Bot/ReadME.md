## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Market Data**: The app uses Yahoo Finance for real-time data. Some tickers may not be available.

2. **Trading Risks**: This is an educational tool. Real trading involves significant risks. Always:
   - Backtest thoroughly
   - Consider transaction costs
   - Implement proper risk management
   - Never trade with money you can't afford to lose

3. **API Limits**: If using ChatGPT, be aware of OpenAI API rate limits and costs.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Insufficient data for analysis"**
   - Try a different date range or stock pair
   - Ensure both stocks have trading data for the selected period

2. **ChatGPT not working**
   - Verify your API key is correctly set
   - Check your OpenAI account has available credits
   - Ensure you have internet connectivity

3. **Slow performance**
   - Analysis may take time for large date ranges
   - Consider reducing the analysis period
   - Check your internet connection for data downloads

## üìà Trading Strategy Explained

The pairs trading strategy implemented here:

1. **Identifies Statistical Relationships**: Uses cointegration testing to find stock pairs that move together
2. **Calculates Spread**: Finds the price relationship using linear regression
3. **Generates Signals**: 
   - Long when z-score < -1.5 (spread too low)
   - Short when z-score > 1.5 (spread too high)
   - Exit when |z-score| < 0.5 (spread normalizes)
4. **Market Neutral**: Profits from relative movements, not market direction
